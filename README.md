## üìÑ **Overview**
The **Quality_APP** aims to achieve the following objectives:

1. **Quality Digitalization**: Transform traditional quality control processes by digitalizing quality data, enabling real-time monitoring and predictive analytics.
2. **Online Quality Engineering**: Implement an online system for quality control during production, integrating machine learning models to predict potential defects and recommend corrective actions.
3. **Reliability Prediction During Development Phase**: Utilize predictive analytics to assess the reliability of battery cells during early development stages, allowing proactive quality improvements.
4. **Optimization of Incoming Materials and On-Site Sampling Inspection**: Enhance inspection efficiency by identifying high-risk batches and adjusting inspection protocols through predictive models.
5. **Delivery Risk Assessment During Mass Production Stage**: Assess delivery risk in mass production by evaluating quality metrics and production data to ensure high-quality output and timely delivery.

## Quality Inspection Insights Using MIL-STD-1916

### 1. Understanding AQL and LTPD

The Acceptable Quality Level (AQL) and Lot Tolerance Percent Defective (LTPD) are key quality metrics:

- **AQL**: The threshold for acceptable quality, with a 5% producer risk (Œ± = 5%) of rejecting a good batch.
- **LTPD**: The tolerance for an unacceptable batch, with a 10% consumer risk (Œ≤ = 10%) of accepting a defective batch.

![AQL and LTPD](plots/aql_ltpd_curve.png)

### 2. Operating Characteristic (OC) Curves for Sampling Plans

The OC curve illustrates the likelihood of batch acceptance based on quality levels. Factors include:
- **Batch Size (N)**: Larger batches create a steeper OC curve, enhancing the distinction between quality levels.
- **Sample Size (n)**: Higher sample sizes lower defect acceptance chances but increase inspection requirements.
- **Acceptance Number (Ac)**: Defines the allowable defects in a sample, balancing consumer and producer risks.

![OC Curves for Sampling Plans](plots/oc_curves_sampling.png)

**Insights:**
- **Batch Size Impact**: Larger batches offer clearer quality distinctions.
- **Sample Size Impact**: Larger samples reduce defect acceptance but require more effort.
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Adjusting the criteria balances risk and inspection effort.

### 3. Sampling Code Comparison

| Batch Size (N) | Sample Size (n) | Acceptance Number (Ac) |
|----------------|-----------------|------------------------|
| 100            | 20              | 0                      |
| 200            | 20              | 0                      |
| 500            | 50              | 0                      |
| 1000           | 100             | 0                      |

### Application in Quality Control

The MIL-STD-1916 standard optimizes inspection and sampling by:
- Setting sample sizes and acceptance criteria to enhance quality assurance while managing inspection efforts.
- Minimizing consumer risk and balancing producer risk to prevent accepting defective batches or rejecting acceptable ones.

These insights align with the project's objectives, providing a structured approach to quality control through systematic sampling and inspection.

### Delivery Risk Assessment During Mass Production

The delivery risk assessment process evaluates potential risks associated with delivering battery cells, modules, or packs during mass production. This assessment is based on data collected throughout production and feedback from various lifecycle stages.

#### Data Sources for Risk Assessment

1. **Full Process Data for Each Batch (Cells/Modules/Packs):**
   - Data from design, manufacturing, materials, and inspection stages.
   - Ensures traceability and highlights quality issues at each production stage.

2. **Failure Data:**
   - **Pack Side Failure Data:** Failures observed during testing or in the field.
   - **OEM Failure Data:** Issues identified by original equipment manufacturers (OEMs).

3. **Customer Feedback and After-Sales Data:**
   - **Market Customer Complaint Data:** Insights from customer feedback.
   - **After-Sales Maintenance Data:** Maintenance records post-sale.
   - **Vehicle Backend System Big Data:** Data from vehicle systems indicating battery performance trends.

#### Key Insights:
- **0km Data Analysis:** Quality control data before market release, ensuring issues are detected early.
- **>0km Data Analysis:** Post-market data analysis for continued quality monitoring and improvement.

These data sources form a robust framework for assessing delivery risks, enabling proactive measures to ensure quality and reduce defects during mass production.

### Recommendations for Battery Cell Testing
![Recommendations for Battery Cell Testing](plots/battery_cell_testing_recommendations.png)

#### 1. Recommendations for Battery Cell Testing
The scatter plot classifies cells as "Short Term Test Recommended" (red) or "Safe for All Usage" (green). Battery cells are identified using the format `P{Pack}_M{Module}_C{Cell}`, aiding quick identification in production. This approach optimizes testing resources, especially for large-scale production across multiple packs and modules.

#### 2. Battery Cell Risk Distribution
The pie chart shows high-risk (30%) vs. low-risk (70%) cells across packs and modules, with IDs like `P1_M2_C5`. This distribution helps focus quality control on high-risk cells, reducing potential failures and enhancing battery pack quality.

#### 3. Battery Cell Risk Score Distribution
The bar chart illustrates the risk score distribution across 100 cells, identified by `P{Pack}_M{Module}_C{Cell}`. A blue dashed line marks the high-risk threshold (75), with cells above this threshold (red) flagged for further inspection. This dynamic testing strategy improves production efficiency and battery reliability by focusing on high-risk cells.

These visualizations provide a data-driven approach to quality control, categorizing cells by risk to prioritize targeted testing.
